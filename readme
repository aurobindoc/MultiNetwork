Input Format is specified as :

Algorithm (Round Robin,Round Robin-Priority) (RR,RRP)
Sim time
Number of queues\data streams
Queue size\buffer size for each stream (same for every queue)
Average Arrival rate of Queue\data stream #1, #2, ……, #n
Average Service time\time taken to send a packet (same for every stream)
Network Switching time

RRP //algorithm
100 //sim time
4 //no of queues
100 //size of queues
5,7,8,9 // average packet inter-arrival time at each queue
4 // average time to send a packet / service time
3 // network switching time
2,1,4,3 //no of packets taken from each queue at a time  (Optional, required only for RRP)
